# SpenT - Spend Your Time Wisely

![SpenT Logo](static/img/logo.jpg)

> **SpenT** represents the philosophy that "Time is Money." It is a powerful, static web application designed to help you track, manage, and optimize your daily time allocation effectively.

---

## 📖 Overview

**SpenT** transforms the abstract concept of time into a tangible asset. By initializing everyday with a "balance" of 86,400 seconds (representing the seconds in a 24-hour day), users can actively "spend" or "invest" their time.

The application operates entirely client-side, using **LocalStorage** to persist your data, ensuring your privacy and allowing for a seamless offline experience.

## ✨ Features

-   **Dashboard**: A central hub displaying your live "Remaining Balance," "Invested Time," and "Wasted Time."
-   **Smart Task Tracking**: Log tasks as "Good" (Invested), "Neutral," or "Bad" (Wasted/Expenses).
-   **Live Analytics**: Visualize your time distribution with dynamic charts and real-time statistics.
-   **Calendar View**: Review your history and track consistency over time.
-   **PDF Reporting**: generated detailed reports of your time usage for accountability.
-   **Privacy Focused**: All data is stored locally on your device. No external servers tracks your movements.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

This project is built with a modern, lightweight stack to ensure speed and reliability:

-   **HTML5**: Semantic structure and accessible markup.
-   **CSS3**: Custom styling with a premium, dark-themed aesthetic.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Dynamic logic for real-time counters, local storage management, and data visualization.
-   **Chart.js**: Interactive graphs for the analytics dashboard.
-   **Kendo UI / html2pdf**: Tools for generating professional PDF reports.
